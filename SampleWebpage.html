<h2>Art Skills Development</h2>
<p><font size="4">Art was just a hobby until I came to the United States. As a high school student, I started my
	freshmen year with Foundation Art, which was a class for beginners. We learned basic stuff like lines, shapes,
	how to shade, and how to do perspective. I liked it a lot, so I continued to take art class every year. During
	my sophomore year, I started working on many media and styles. It was this year that I finally had a chance to
	paint on wood and canvas, but then I did not do much od art my Junior year because I was taking two courses of art.
	The assignment was overloaded. I did not like painting that much until my Senior year. I started to like painting
	more than drawing. I took a higher course as year went by to develop my skills. In my senior year, I took a
	highest level of art class, an AP Art. Because the time was rush, painting was the best solution to finish a project.
	It is convenient and fast. During this time, I had many opportunities to submit many of my work for a couple
	competitions outside of school. Even though I did not win anything, but I was already very happy that I got nominated.</font><p>

<h2>My Artwork</h2>
<p><font size="4">Below are some samples of my artwork. Because a concentration for my AP Art Portfolio was surrealism, there are many surrealistic art pieces.</font></p>
